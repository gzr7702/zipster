A simple zip utility, written in Python, that will zip a directory. The full path of the directory is passed to the function and a
zip file is is created with the top directory.

- ziprelative.py, test_ziprelative.py

- Uses Python version 3.2, but should work with older versions.

- A handy test case has been included. Remember to run this first when you add new features!

- You will need to change the test path in test_ziprelative.py to match wherever you are testing from.
