A simple zip utility, written in Python, that will zip a directory. The full path of the directory is passed to the function and a
zip file is is created with the top directory.

- ziprelative.py, test_ziprelative.py

- Uses Python version 3.2, but should work with older versions.

- A handy test case has been included. Remember to run this first when you add new features!

- Created by Rob Graziano

- This commit: cleaned up code, changed to argparse, cleaned up test case to call app directly.
