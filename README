A simple zip utility, written in Python, that will zip a directory. The full path of the directory is passed to the function and a
zip file is is created with the top directory.

- Usage:
   zipster -s <source dir> -d <dest dir> 
   source directory is not optional. Destination directory is optional.

- files: ziprelative.py, test_ziprelative.py

- Uses Python version 3.2, but should work with older versions.

- A handy test case has been included. Remember to run this first when you add new features!
